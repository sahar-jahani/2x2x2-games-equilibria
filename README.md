# Automated Equilibrium Enumeration and 3D Representation of 2x2x2 Games

This Python application computes **all equilibria** of **2√ó2√ó2 strategic-form non-cooperative games** and generates a **3D visualisation** of the best response surfaces. It follows the symmetric representation and algorithms explained in the paper linked below.

## üìå Description

Using the methods presented in our paper, this tool allows users to input a 2√ó2√ó2 game, automatically computes all equilibria, and renders an interactive 3D plot of all best response surfaces for deeper game-theoretic analysis.

## üéÆ Input Formats

Our formulation of 2√ó2√ó2 games is symmetric across players, using a cyclical clockwise order of players: 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3. For example, for player 1, the next player is player 2 and the previous player is player 3. 

We denote the mixed strategy parameters of players 1, 2, and 3 as:

- `x‚ÇÅ = p`,  
- `x‚ÇÇ = q`,  
- `x‚ÇÉ = r`.

Following the cyclical order, we define `x‚ÇÄ = r` and `x‚ÇÑ = p` to handle indexing smoothly.

We support several representations of 2√ó2√ó2 games, and input can be provided in any of the following formats for players' payoffs:

###  Normalized Form

![Normalized matrix representation of 2x2x2 games](2x2x2_normalized_matrix.png)

In the normalized form, the payoff matrix is simplified by subtracting the payoff of the first strategy from both strategies for each player, keeping the opponent's strategies fixed. As a result, the expected payoff of the first strategy is always zero. This transformation does **not** change the best responses of the players but significantly simplifies the analysis.

Under this representation, for each player $i \in \{1,2,3\}$, the player's payoff is specified using four scalar values `[A·µ¢, B·µ¢, C·µ¢, D·µ¢]`, corresponding to the values in the matrix format above.

The expected payoff function `S·µ¢(x·µ¢‚Çä‚ÇÅ, x·µ¢‚Çã‚ÇÅ)` for player $i$ can then be computed as:


$$
S_i(x_{i+1},x_{i-1}) = (1-x_{i+1}) (1-x_{i-1}) A_i + x_{i+1} (1-x_{i-1}) B_i + (1-x_{i+1}) x_{i-1} C_i + x_{i+1} x_{i-1} D_i
$$

### Hyperbolic Form 

The expected payoff function from the normalized form can be rewritten by defining new parameters as follows:

$$
S_i(x_{i+1}, x_{i-1}) = M_i \, x_{i+1} x_{i-1} + K_i \, x_{i+1} + L_i \, x_{i-1} + A_i
$$

where

$$
M_i = A_i - B_i - C_i + D_i, \quad K_i = B_i - A_i,  \quad L_i = C_i - A_i
$$

So in the hyperbolic form, for each player $i \in \{1, 2, 3\}$, the player's payoff is specified using four scalar values `[M·µ¢, K·µ¢, L·µ¢, A·µ¢]`.


### Product Form 

If $M_i \neq 0$, the expected payoff functions from the hyperbolic form can be rewritten in product form as follows:

\begin{align}
		S_1(q,r)=& \quad(q - q_1) &\times \quad & (r - r_2)\quad -& K_1&\\
		S_2(r,p)=& \quad(r - r_1) &\times \quad & (p - p_2)\quad -& K_2&\\
		S_3(p,q)=& \quad(p - p_1) &\times \quad & (q - q_2)\quad -& K_3&\\
\end{align}

Therefore, in the product form, all players' payoffs can be represented together by ``[p‚ÇÅ, q‚ÇÇ, K‚ÇÅ]``, ``[r‚ÇÅ, p‚ÇÇ, K‚ÇÇ]``, ``[q‚ÇÅ, r‚ÇÇ, K‚ÇÉ]``.

## üöÄ How to Run

The code is implemented in **Python 3** and requires the packages `numpy` and `matplotlib` to be installed.

You can run the main script with:

```bash
python RUN.py
```
with the following as command arguments. 

Alternatively, if the code is run without arguments, a description of the options below will be shown, and arguments can be given interactively in active mode.
